# Credit card fraud detection 

# Project Overview
This data project aims to develop a Credit card Fraud Detection system using Machine Learning with Python

# Data Sources
Creditcard Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "Creditcard Data" file, is a publicly available dataset on Kaggle (Link : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud ). 

# Tools
	• Excel csv
	• GoogleColab - Model development 

# Model
In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
	* pandas
  * numpy
  * from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
  * from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
  * from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
  
# Steps involved

* Import of required libraries
* Checking the number of missing values 
* Separating the data for analysis
* Building a subsample
* Check of the mean of new dataset
* Splitting the data into Features & Targets
* Split the data into Training data & Testing Data
* Model Training with Logistic Regression
* Model Evaluation and Accuracy Score

# Results
The analysis results are summarized as follows:
* Accuracy on Training data :  0.9466840052015605
* Accuracy score on Test Data :  0.9430051813471503
